## 📝 Description

This is my personal website serving as my programming portfolio.

Much structural and design inspiration came from [Brittany Chiang's impeccable personal site](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4). I put together a warm theme which was heavily influenced by the unique portrayal of futurism and technology in the film _Her_.

In showcasing my coding projects, I took a great piece of advice from [Aaron Jack's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g) and used screen recordings to easily display my applications' capabilities in demo videos.
